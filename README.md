# DataAnalysisProject
My personal educational endeavour into data analysis of a structured climate dataset primarily using Pandas library to clean and transform the data as well as performing preliminary dataset analysis. The second stage of the project involves using the Mathplotlib library to make graphs with out of the data, that can provide me with valuable insight into the dataset. The final stage is about using machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow to perform predictive models on the dataset that can be extrapolated onto countries that were not included in the dataset or to derive future trends from the data.  

## About the dataset
From the website of Food and Agriculture for the United Nations, "AQUASTAT is the FAO global information system on water resources and agricultural water management. It collects, analyses and provides free access to over 180 variables and indicators by country from 1960. AQUASTAT draws on national capacities and expertise with an emphasis on Africa, the Near East, countries of the former Soviet Union, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean."
